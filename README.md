## 🎨 **SCSS & React Theme Switcher Project**  

This project is a **hands-on learning experience** where I explored **SCSS (SASS)** styling within a **React + TypeScript** application.  

🚀 The main challenge? Building a **theme switcher** that dynamically toggles between **light** and **dark** modes with a smooth user experience. 🌙☀️  

---

### 🔥 **What I Built & Learned:**  
✅ **React Context** for global theme management.  
✅ **SCSS Magic** – mastering:  
   - 🎨 **Variables** for consistent styling.  
   - 📂 **Nesting** for cleaner, structured code.  
   - 🚀 **Mixins** to keep styles DRY.  
✅ **TypeScript** for type safety and better code reliability.  

This isn't just a project—it's a deep dive into **SCSS + React synergy!** 💡

This project was built for **learning & experimentation**, not production—just me leveling up my SCSS skills. 😎🔥
